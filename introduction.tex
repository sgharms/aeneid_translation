\chapter{Introduction}

These are the translations and notes that I made in Spring 2009 while taking Latin IV (LAT312K) at
The University of Texas at Austin with Amanda Kimura.  We covered about half of Books I and II of 
The {\AE}neid by Vergil.  The book was written by Clyde Pharr and released by Bolchazy publications.
